For this server, the code has been divided into several foders detailing tests and different express routes. The 'middleware' and 'test' folders contain middleware and tests respectively, and each other folder in the src directory contains a router and service object for the named route. Outside of the main code in the src directory there is also a migrations folder containing the migrations for the project's tables, and a seeds folder containing some seed data for the tables.
